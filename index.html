							<h2>A different approach</h2>
							<p>You've tried. But the textbooks and vocab lists aren't doing it for you. Not even months of duolingo is making you feel able to speak. The truth is nothing can replace actual speaking practice and why not do it in an efficient, intentional way with an experienced tutor who meets you where you are and gently pushes your bar higher.</p>

									<h3>Immersion experience</h3>
									<p>Feel like you're immersed in a foreign place where virtually all dialogue is done in the language. So even 30min can feel intense. You're working hard.</p>
								</section>
								<section>
									<span class="icon solid major fa-lock"></span>
									<h3>Lock in the basics</h3>
									<p>You have to master the basics and it's surprising how far this gets you. Once you have a solid foundation, building is lot easier.</p>
								</section>
								<section>
									<span class="icon solid major fa-cog"></span>
									<h3>Learn by doing</h3>
									<p>Rather than studying grammar tables and vocab lists, be challenged to form natural and relevant sentences which will enable you to acquire the language organically</p>
								</section>
								<section>
									<span class="icon solid major fa-code"></span>
									<h3>Speak with flow</h3>
									<p>By practicing speaking you develop fluidness and dynamic movement between structures and tenses, whatever your level, even as a beginner</p>

									<p>I developed this different way of languages tuition after realising how inefficient, frustrating and boring the conventional way is. I began to see the language skill like another muscle that needs to be trained and put into action rather than listening to endless explanations and rules. And when we do tap into our natural language acquisition ability, something magic happens. We understand patterns of structures intuitively and it just starts to flow. Your fitness builds and you find another gear - Robin S.</p>
